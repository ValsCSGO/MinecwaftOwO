I still don't know if I should be proud or mildly upset that I did this. This mod uses ASM to change the FontRenderer.renderStringAtPos method and change the text right before it gets drawn on screen. All of the text. Everywhere. No exceptions.

The mod is completely client side so you will have no problems with any anti-cheat systems on servers. Its just changing a rendering method. Because of how much the mod takes over, it might not work with some other mods. Crash at your own risk. Also, even the chat text box is taken over so be weady to type owo style. You are still physically typing and sending what you think you are, it is just getting changed right before it gets rendered so you can still send commands like "/help" it will just look like "/hewp" as you type it. Good luck.

To toggle the mod on and off, use the command **/MinecwaftOwO**
*NOTE* remember, ALL text gets replaced including text you are about to send so even this command will get warped to */MinyecwaftOwO*
You can still send the command, you still typed what you think you typed, its just changed the way it shows up on screen.

Thanks to [FalseHonesty](https://github.com/FalseHonesty) for the help with the ASM. He is at least part of the blame for this.
